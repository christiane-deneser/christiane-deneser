# Hi, I’m Christiane (she/her) 👋 💖 
**Senior Frontend Developer · Accessibility Specialist · Design Systems · ex-Ableton**

I help teams build **accessible, maintainable, and user-centered web interfaces** — combining:

- **Frontend engineering (HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Web Components)**
- **Accessibility leadership (WCAG, EN 301 549, BITV)**
- **Design systems & scalable architecture**
- **Agile, evidence-based product thinking**

I have 10+ years of experience working on long-running, high-traffic, direct-to-consumer platforms, most recently at Ableton, where I shaped 
frontend architecture, built accessible component systems, and helped to integrate accessibility across design and development workflows.

Today, I work at the intersection of of frontend development, inclusive design, accessibility engineering, and AI-assisted development.

## 🧭 What I’m focusing on right now

- Building my **`a11y-lab`** on GitHub:
  - Accessible UI components and custom widgets    
  - Keyboard & screen reader behavior
  - WCAG 2.2 / EN 301 549 mapping
  - Notes for developers & designers
- Exploring how AI can support frontend developemnt workflows    
- Preparing for **IAAP WAS** exams and deepening my accessibility expertise

## 🧩 My Professional Toolbox

**Accessibility**

- WCAG 2.2, EN 301 549, BITV
- Manual keyboard testing
- Screen readers: VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS
- Dynamic behavior: focus management, live regions, state changes
- Automated testing: axe, Accessibility Insights

**Frontend Engineering**

- Semantic HTML & accessible patterns
- CSS/SCSS architecture, responsive layouts, reduced motion
- JavaScript (ES6 and class syntax, modular architectures, selective enhancement)
- Web Components
- Django CMS, Twig, Handlebars, Mustache
- React / Next.js / Vue.js (working knowledge)

**Design Systems & Architecture**

- Reusable component libraries
- Documentation, structure
- Predictable patterns 
- Scaling components across multiple teams

**AI-assisted workflow**

- GitHub Copilot for scaffolding

**Agile Collaboration**

- Scrum (PSM I, PSPO I)
- Working in cross-functional teams (product, design, QA, backend)
- Evidence-based decisions, MVP thinking, value-driven delivery
- Mentoring, code reviews, RFC processes

## 🧱 How I work as a Frontend Engineer

My engineering approach is grounded in:

- Delivering real value to users and to the business
- Making thoughtful technical decisions in cross-functional teams
- Balancing speed, quality, and sustainability
- Improving long-running product codebases

I care deeply about:

- maintainability
- performance
- readability
- progressive enhancement
- clean architecture
- codebases that support teams long-term

I build frontends that are:

- modular
- predictable
- accessible
- easy to extend
- aligned with product goals and user needs

This mindset comes from years of working on complex, evolving, revenue-critical platforms like Ableton’s e-commerce and marketing environment.

## 🧪 Featured projects & directions

*(Repos may be renamed / reorganized as my a11y-lab evolves.)*

- **`a11y-lab`**  
  Sandbox for accessible UI components, patterns, and experiments.  
  Each component aims to include:
  - Clear purpose & usage  
  - Keyboard and screen reader behavior  
  - WCAG / EN 301 549 mapping  
  - Code examples (HTML/CSS/JS)  
  - Notes on common pitfalls & anti-patterns  

- **Accessible Component Library (work in progress)**  
  A structured set of components such as:
  - Buttons & link patterns
  - Dialogs & modals
  - Navigation & menus
  - Tabs, accordions, sliders
  - Visually hidden utility and skip links

- **WCAG Learning Notes**  
  My personal notes on:
  - Guidelines, success criteria in plain language
  - Typical issues found in audits
  - Testing strategies and triage approaches

## 💖 Work culture & what I value (reflection from Ableton)

During my time at **Ableton**, I worked with some of the most skilled, generous, and deeply professional people I’ve ever met.  
But the real gift was the **culture**:

- welcoming  
- human  
- emotionally intelligent  
- inclusive  
- friendly  
- safe  

This shaped me profoundly.

It also clarified what I value in my next role:  
I want to work with **kind, thoughtful people** who communicate openly, support each other, and care about the work *and* the humans doing it.

## 📚 Currently learning & exploring

- Deepening my understanding of **WCAG 2.2** success criteria  
- Building **EN 301 549** awareness into day-to-day design & dev decisions  
- Designing **neuro-inclusive interfaces**:
  - Reducing cognitive load
  - Clear paths, gentle pacing, predictable patterns
- Using **AI to accelerate development**

## 🌍 Beyond code

I’m also a **movement artist & visual storyteller** — working with photography, film, and performance.
