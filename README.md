# Hi, I’m Christiane (she/her) 👋 💖 
**Accessibility Specialist · Neuro-Inclusive UX · ex-Frontend Dev @ Ableton**

I help teams build **accessible, human-centered digital products** — with a special focus on:

- **Web accessibility (WCAG 2.2 / EN 301 549 / EAA)**
- **Neuro-inclusive, low-friction user experiences**
- **Bridging design, development, and process (Scrum, product, design systems)**

I have ~10 years of experience as a frontend developer with a strong accessibility focus.  
Today, I work at the intersection of **accessibility leadership, inclusive design, and AI-assisted workflows**.

## 🧭 What I’m focusing on right now

- Building my **`a11y-lab`** on GitHub:
  - Small, focused **accessible UI components** (buttons, dialogs, navigation…)
  - Each mapped to **WCAG 2.2 / EN 301 549** criteria  
  - With clear keyboard behavior, screen reader notes, and developer guidance
- Developing a personal curriculum:  
  **“Master of Neuro-Inclusive & AI-Adaptive Experience Design”**  
  → exploring how AI can *support* accessibility, not replace it
- Preparing for **IAAP / WAS-style** exams and consolidating my WCAG knowledge
- Refreshing my public profile (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio) so employers can see my **accessibility depth** at a glance

## 🧩 My accessibility toolbox

**Standards & frameworks**

- WCAG **2.1 / 2.2**
- **EN 301 549**
- European **Accessibility Act (EAA)** mindset (web, apps, services)
- BITV & EU public sector requirements

**Testing & review**

- Manual keyboard testing
- Screen readers:
  - NVDA, JAWS (Windows)
  - VoiceOver (macOS / iOS)
- Browser dev tools (Chrome / Firefox)
- Automated tools:
  - **axe DevTools**
  - **Accessibility Insights for Web**
  - Lighthouse, WAVE, plus browser a11y tree inspection

**Code & implementation**

- Semantic HTML5, accessible forms, landmarks, structure
- CSS (focus states, reduced motion, contrast, responsive layouts)
- ARIA *only when needed* (role, name, state, properties)
- Design systems, component libraries, and design–dev collaboration

**AI-assisted workflows**

- GitHub Copilot & modern AI tools to:
  - suggest accessible patterns
  - scaffold tests & documentation
  - support accessibility reviews
  - generate examples & learning materials

## 🧪 Featured projects & directions

*(Repos may be renamed / reorganized as my a11y-lab evolves.)*

- **`a11y-lab`**  
  Sandbox for accessible UI components, patterns, and experiments.  
  Each component aims to include:
  - Clear purpose & usage  
  - Keyboard and screen reader behavior  
  - WCAG / EN 301 549 mapping  
  - Code examples (HTML/CSS/JS)  
  - Notes on common pitfalls & anti-patterns  

- **Accessible Component Library (work in progress)**  
  A structured set of components such as:
  - Buttons & link patterns
  - Dialogs & modals
  - Navigation & menus
  - Tabs, accordions, sliders
  - Visually hidden utility and skip links

- **WCAG Learning Notes**  
  My personal notes on:
  - Guidelines, success criteria in plain language
  - Typical issues found in audits
  - Testing strategies and triage approaches

## 💖 Work culture & what I value (reflection from Ableton)

During my time at **Ableton**, I worked with some of the most skilled, generous, and deeply professional people I’ve ever met.  
But the real gift was the **culture**:

- welcoming  
- human  
- emotionally intelligent  
- inclusive  
- friendly  
- safe  

This shaped me profoundly.

It also clarified what I value in my next role:  
I want to work with **kind, thoughtful people** who communicate openly, support each other, and care about the work *and* the humans doing it.

Accessibility is ultimately about people and how we treat each other — and the best teams understand that.

## 📚 Currently learning & exploring

- Deepening my understanding of **WCAG 2.2** success criteria  
- Building **EN 301 549** awareness into day-to-day design & dev decisions  
- Designing **neuro-inclusive interfaces**:
  - Reducing cognitive load
  - Clear paths, gentle pacing, predictable patterns
- Using **AI to accelerate accessible development**:
  - Accessibility-flavoured code suggestions
  - Drafting documentation, checklists, and audit summaries
  - Experimenting with AI-based learning helpers for teams

---

## 🤝 How I like to work

- **Collaborative**: I enjoy pairing with designers, devs, testers, and PMs  
- **Pragmatic**: Accessibility must fit real-world constraints and workflows  
- **Educational**: I love turning audit findings into **guides, patterns, and shared practices**  
- **Systems-thinking**: From one-off fixes to **accessible design systems** and sustainable processes

Past experience includes:
- Working as a **Frontend Developer & Accessibility Specialist at Ableton**,  
  contributing to:
  - accessible components
  - WCAG / EN 301 549 audit & remediation
  - better acceptance criteria & Definition of Done for accessibility

## 🌍 Beyond code

I’m also a **movement artist & visual storyteller** — working with photography, film, and performance.  
This creative background influences my approach to:

- embodiment in interaction  
- sensory clarity  
- visual rhythm & hierarchy  
- emotional and experiential design
